*(Disclaimer: This version fo the bot only works with one server at a time. I will rewrite it to add more server support sometime in the far future; this was just an idea given to me by one of my friends that I thought would be cool. I spent less than an hour on the final design, all things told, so I don't want to spend more than that time bugfixing it.)*

You don't have to give credit to me. That's not what Github is for (in my opinion).
